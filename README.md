# Image-Classifier

a general architecture for a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can be used for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

Input layer: The input layer takes in the images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which are RGB images of size 32x32.

Convolutional layers: The convolutional layers are the core of the CNN and extract features from the input images. In general, there can be multiple convolutional layers, each with multiple filters to detect different types of features in the image. For example, the first convolutional layer could have 32 filters of size 3x3, the second convolutional layer could have 64 filters of size 3x3, and so on. Each convolutional layer is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function to introduce nonlinearity into the model.

Max pooling layers: Max pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers. In general, after every 2-3 convolutional layers, a max pooling layer is added to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. For example, a max pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2 and a stride of 2 can be used.

Dropout layers: Dropout layers are used to prevent overfitting of the model by randomly dropping out neurons during training. A dropout rate of 0.25-0.5 can be used after every few convolutional layers.

Flatten layer: The flatten layer is used to convert the 2D feature maps generated by the convolutional layers into a 1D feature vector.

Dense layers: The dense layers are used for classification and can be added on top of the flattened feature vector. In general, there can be multiple dense layers, each with a different number of neurons. The final dense layer has 10 neurons, one for each class in the CIFAR-10 dataset, and uses a softmax activation function to output the class probabilities.

Output layer: The output layer is used to output the predicted class for each image in the dataset.

The exact number of layers and parameters used in the model can vary depending on the specific problem being tackled, and hyperparameters such as the learning rate, optimizer, and batch size can also be tuned to improve performance.
